This system aims to streamline and automate the entire process of placing and fulfilling orders, encom-
passing interactions between the diner, the waiter, and the kitchen. By incorporating
this system, we not only ensure a more hygienic food service process but also sig-
nificantly reduce the time required for order processing and delivery.
A key advantage of this approach is the elimination of the need for a waiter in the
traditional sense. The system takes over the entire order delivery process, reduc-
ing the dependency on human intervention and subsequently lowering the number of
employees required in the restaurant system. This automated solution proves partic-
ularly beneficial during busy periods, enabling restaurant owners to maintain smooth
operations without compromising customer satisfaction. The Smart Restaurant Ser-
vice thus represents a significant step towards efficient and contactless restaurant
operations, addressing both hygiene concerns and operational challenges in the in-
dustry.
